# Ghana--District-Information

Welcome to this repository, a collection of shape files showcasing Ghana's district boundaries and a dataset of point of interest data highlighting hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, including large hospitals. 
As a resource designed to provide a deeper understanding of Ghana's geography and healthcare infrastructure, this repository is a valuable asset for researchers, geographers, healthcare professionals, and enthusiasts alike.

Please note that while I have compiled and curated this data during my Masters degree, I do not own any of the information contained within this repository. 
I will continue to update it as I discover new and useful information.

Cheers!
