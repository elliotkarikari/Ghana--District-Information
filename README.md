# Deprivation and Health in Ghana
## Assessing Deprivation at the District Level using Census Data from 2021 to Examine Access to Health Care in Ghana.


Welcome to this repository, a collection of shape files showcasing Ghana's district boundaries and a dataset of point of interest data highlighting hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, including large hospitals. 

Please note that while I have compiled this data during my Masters degree, I do not own any of the information contained within this repository. 
I will continue to update it as I discover new and useful information.

Cheers!
