# Deprivation and Health in Ghana
## Assessing Deprivation at the District Level using Census Data from 2021 to Examine Access to Health Care in Ghana.

Understanding the regional variation of a country’s socio-economic disadvantage is crucial for 
successful resource allocation in its growth. Though the measure of deprivation is not new in 
Ghana, previous research indicates that the one-dimensional income technique is extensively 
used to identify the poor on a regional scale. This study using the Index of Multiple Deprivation, 
analyses deprivation at the district level by merging four socio-economic indicators from Ghana’s 
2021 census. Deprivation has an impact on every part of a country’s economy. To better 
understand its impact, healthcare provision was contrasted with and compared to level of 
deprivation in Ghana.

Welcome to this repository, a collection of data I used for my Masters Dissertation. This contains shape files showcasing Ghana's district boundaries and a dataset of point of interest data highlighting hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, including large hospitals and census data at the district level. 

Please note that while I have gathered this data during my Masters degree, **I do not own any of the information contained within this repository.** 
I will continue to update it as I discover new and useful information relevant to Ghana. 

Cheers!
